The rise of automation, along with increased computational power, novel application of statistical algorithms, and improved accessibility to data, have resulted in the birth of the personal digital assistant market, popularly represented by Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Google’s Google Assistant, and Amazon’s Alexa.
While each assistant may specialize in slightly different tasks, they all seek to make the user’s life easier through verbal interactions so you don’t have to search out a keyboard to find answers to questions like “What’s the weather today?” or “Where is Switzerland?”. Despite the inherent “cool” factor that comes with using a digital assistant, you may find that the aforementioned digital assistants don’t cater to your specific needs. Fortunately, it’s relatively easy to build your own.
The implemented voice assistant can perform the following task it can open YouTube,Search on Google, Open calculator, Send an email, Predict current time, take a photo, search Wikipedia to abstract required data, and can answer computational and geographical questions too.
The following queries of the voice assistant can be manipulated as per the users need. 
There still a scope to optimize the whole voice assistant with the help of unsupervised machine learning models.
